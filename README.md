Program that shows how algorithm of finding articulation points in graph works

V - total amount of vertices (MAX=20)
X in 1..V:
    VX VPi (i in 0..(V-1)) - number of vertice and list of vertices, that make pair to VX \\New Line
COORDS - indicator for coords list start
i in 1..V:
    Xi Yi - coordinates of vertice Vi \\New Line!!!

Example:

#1
2
1 2
2 1
COORDS
35 46 - #1 vertice
29 87 - #2 vertice

#2
3
1 3
2
3 1
COORDS
76 32
28 34
98 37
